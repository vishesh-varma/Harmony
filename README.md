This project is no longer maintained, and no longer works because of changes in spot-dl, one of its most important dependencies.
# Harmony
 A Python script that allows users to download all of the songs all of the major streaming platforms to be downloaded on your PC. Currently the GitHub version only has the GUI, but soon there will be addition of the backend as well.
 
### Currently Harmony can only download music from spotify, there will be upgrades as the project moves on!
## Usage
 Zip the code, unzip wherever you want. In the directory field of your windows explorer, type `cmd`, to open the command line in that directory. Here, type `python gui.py` or `python3 gui.py` to see the GUI. You need to have Python 3.x installed

## Dependencies
You **need** to have these downloaded to run the script:
- Pillow(pip install pillow)
- Spotdl(pip install spotdl)
- ffmpeg
The rest should be installed by default
